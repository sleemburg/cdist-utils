# NAME

runcdist

# SYNOPSIS

`runcdist [OPTION]... <arguments>...`

# DESCRIPTION

A wrapper around the cdist software to make running cdist easier. This wrapper
relies on the inventory function of cdist.

Arguments that can be used are:

`-c`
Source a specific cdistrc file before starting cdist.

`-v`
Make output more verbose. Each `-v` increases the verbosity.

`-q`
Make output quiet.

`-p`
Run the configuration of hosts in parallel.

`-o <manifest>`
Overrule running any generic manifest and only run the specified manifest.

`-t`
All arguments are to be considered tags. All tags need to be present for a host to be
selected. Run cdist with resulting hosts.

`-T`
All arguments are to be considered tags. Any of the tags need to be present for a host to 
be selected. Run cdist with resulting hosts.

`-l`
All arguments are to be considered tags. All tags need to be present for a host to be
selected. List all resulting hosts.

`-T`
All arguments are to be considered tags. Any of the tags need to be present for a host to 
be selected. List all resulting hosts.

`-a`
Run manifest(s) on all hosts in inventory.

`-d`
Dry run, don't execute types (will run manifests)

`-x`
Run in debug mode

# CONFIGURATION FILE

Runcdist will see if there is an `~/.runcdist.ini` configuration file. If this file
exists, it is expected to be in ini style format. The following headings are recognized.

`[main]`

This section has the following settings:

`parrallel`

Default the number of CPU's will be used as the value for parrallellism when running
with the -p option. Setting parrallel will override this.

`cdistrc`

The default cdistrc file is `~/.cdistrc`. Setting this option will use the value as the
default cdistrc file to source.

`[postrun]`

Item name can be arbitrary and will be sorted. The value of each item will be treated as
a command that will be run after the main cdist run. There are variables that can optionally
be used in the commands:
`$CDISTRET`: The return value of the cdist command
`${CDISTARGS[]}': Array of the options the runcdist command was started with

# EXAMPLES

Run cdist for all systems tagged as server

`runcdist -t server`

Run cdist with the exim manifest on all systems tagged as mailer and be verbose.

`rundist -v -o exim -t mailer`

Config file to set default parrallellism to 5 and run `cdist-inventory` after each
run.
```
[main]
parrallel=5

[postrun]
step1=cdist-inventory
```
